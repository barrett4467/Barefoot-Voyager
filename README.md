# Welcome to Bearfoot Voyager
 
Hello Travelers! This app was created in mind for travelers traveling to a new city,state, or even country.
What this app does is it gives you information on what the weather is like at the destination, events that are going on and news revolving around that destination. We have also added to where it will being up videos about the area and Brewery locations in the area as well. We wanted to make finding information about your destination easier than having to check multiple sites. This is the all in one for you!
 
## APIs
So we were able to use APIs from Youtube, Ticketmaster, newsapi.org, OpenWeather, and OpenBreweryDB. These APIs are able to find out about your destination and give you info about them!
 
- Youtube
   - With the YouTube API, it will bring up videos of the combined search of the destinations and the interests. It will embed 3 videos based on the results.
 
- Ticketmaster
   - The Ticketmaster API gives you the ability to see which events will be coming up during the next few weeks.
 
- NewsAPI.org
   - This API will give you relevant news articles that might catch your attention. The news does come from multiple new sources so you know that they will be accurate.
 
- OpenWeather
   -   With the OpenWeather API, you are able to see what the forecast for the location of the destination. Not only does it give you the current temperature, it gives you the high/low for the day, the wind speed, current conditions and also a 5 day forecast!
 
- OpenBreweryDB
   - OpenBrewryDB gives you some breweries in the surrounding locations.
 
## New Technology
The new technology that we implemented was the Date Range picker library. With this technology, you're able to pick the date that you'll be traveling to the destination and see what will be going on during that day due to the connection with the APIs.
